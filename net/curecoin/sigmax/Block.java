	/**
     * Constructor for Block object. A block object is made for any confirmed or potential network block, and requires all pieces of data in this constructor
     * to be a valid network block. The timestamp is the result of the miner's initial call to System.currentTimeMillis(). When peers are receiving new blocks
     * (synced with the network, not catching up) they will refuse any blocks that are more than 2 hours off their internal adjusted time. This makes difficulty
     * malleability impossible in the long-run, ensures that timestamps are reasonably accurate, etc. As a result, any clients far off from the true network time
     * will be forked off the network as they won't accept valid network blocks. Make sure your computer's time is set correctly!
     * 
     * All blocks stack in one particular order, and each block contains the hash of the previous block, to clear any ambiguities about which chain a block belongs
     * to during a fork. The winning nonce is concatenated with the miner address and transaction merkle root and hashed to get a mining score, which is 
     * then used to determine whether a block is under the target difficulty. 
     * 
     * Blocks are hashed to create a block hash, which ensures blocks are not altered, and is used in block stacking. The data hashed is formatted as a String:
     * {timestamp:blockNum:previousBlockHash:difficulty:winningNonce:minerAddress}#{ledgerHash}#{transactions}
     * The hash is then appended to the block data, to produce the full block:
     * {timestamp:blockNum:previousBlockHash:difficulty:winningNonce:minerAddress}#{ledgerHash}#{transactions}#{blockHash}
     * 
     * A higher difficulty means a block is harder to mine. However, a higher difficulty means the TARGET is smaller. Targets can be calculated from the difficulty. A target is simply Long.MAX_VALUE-difficulty.
     * 
     * Explicit transactions are represented as Transaction objects in an ArrayList<Transaction>.
     * 
     * @param timestamp Timestamp originally set into the block by the miner
